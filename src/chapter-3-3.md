Nurturing Supportive Networks

Developing Adaptability

Learning from Failure

2. **Resilient Problem-Solving**: Embrace failure as an integral part of the creative problem-solving process. Adopt a resilient problem-solving mindset that allows you to bounce back from setbacks quickly, reframe challenges as opportunities, and persevere in the pursuit of solutions.

Developing Coping Mechanisms

2. **Maintaining Work-Life Balance**: Strive for a balance between work and personal life. Prioritize self-care, set boundaries, and allocate time for activities that bring joy and fulfillment outside of problem-solving efforts.

Setting Realistic Expectations
